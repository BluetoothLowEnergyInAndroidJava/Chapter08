# Bluetooth Low Energy in Android Java

## Chapter 8: Writing Data to a Peripheral


These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy with Android Java_.  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices using iOS/Swift.  

This chapter teaches:
* Central: Write data to a Characteristic on a connected Peripheral
* Peripheral: Receive and process Write requests on a hosted Characteristic
